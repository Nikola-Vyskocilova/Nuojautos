Where do you ship to?<br>
<br>
We ship worldwide.
<br>
When will I get my order?<br>
<br>
Items are made to order to reduce unnecessary waste. Usually the whole process of manufacturing and shipping takes 5 to 7 business days.

What inks do you use?<br>

We use water-based and eco-friendly inks. We use a special solution in the printing process, so don't worry if you notice a slight new shirt scent or some discolouration. It will disappear after the first wash.
