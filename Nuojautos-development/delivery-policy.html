    <h3 class="FAQText">Delivery Policy (for Tangible Goods)</h3>
    <p class="FAQText">All orders are subject to product availability. If an item in your order is unavailable, we will ship you the part of your order that is available. When that item becomes available, we will ship you the rest of your order. Shipping costs for your order are non-refundable and are based on the weight of the items you order and your location. The date of delivery for your order may vary due to carrier shipping practices, delivery location, method of delivery and the quantity of items ordered, and in addition your order may be delivered in separate shipments. All orders are sent out in 5 to 7 business days. Additional shipping charges may apply depending on your location and the size of your order. You are responsible for all taxes applicable to the delivery of your order, including sales tax, value added tax, custom duties and excise duties. If there is any damage to the items that you ordered on delivery, you must contact us within 5 days from receipt of your order.</p>
